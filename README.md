## Acquisition-Status-Prediction-App

Any company/startup old/new are prone to get closed any time. In this project, we are trying to identify if a company is closed or not, with the help of few features. 

### Understanding the dataset
The data is scrapped from Crunchbase, a platform to gain insights about the business information about public and private companies [https://www.crunchbase.com/]. It consists of basic information, like: name, funding, tags, ...etc.

The label of the dataset is the acquisition status of each company: Operating, IPO, Acquired, and Closed.
